# RESP_API-in-PHP

My language of choice is javascript for both frontend and backend. I was a little thrown off when I needed to build a project with php. But I was up to the task. 

This is a basic CRUD api built with php and mysqli using OOP concepts. 

Here are links to resources that helped me complete this
https://www.php.net/docs.php -> The official php documentation 
https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_intro.asp -> The sections on sql queries. This helped me recall syntax for some of the queries as I have been too accustomed to mongo. 

To run this project, you'd need post man to send the GET, POST, PUT, DELETE request to the respective files.
